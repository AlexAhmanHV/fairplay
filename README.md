Personas
Linnea
An enthusiastic amateur golfer who plays 1–2 times a week.
She values a clean interface, minimal steps per action, and dislikes unnecessary complexity.
For her, the app should feel quick, reliable, and supportive during her rounds.

Johan
A casual golfer who plays mostly with friends or colleagues.
He’s technically competent but impatient — if the app feels slow or cluttered, he’ll stop using it.
He needs a fast, straightforward scorekeeper with clear feedback and weather context.

Planned features:
“Start new round” flow with score and hole tracking
 Statistics and progress overview
 Settings screen (theme, units, preferences)
 Optional cloud sync (Firebase)
 Export round history

Design vision:
The app follows a light version of Material Design, emphasizing readability and smooth user flow.
Accent colors are green and white — inspired by the calm and clarity of a golf course.
